// > >=< <= == !=

console.log("2">1);
console.log("02">1);

// here js does automatic conversion of string to number but it can give errors smwhere
// thus it is advised to COMPARE SAME DATA TYPES

console.log(null >0);//or >= ==
// == and >=or> works differently as compared to each other
//for undefined it can be checked too wrt to 0
 
/*
FOR STRICT CHECK -> ==== CHECKS alue as well as datatype
*/

console.log("2"===2);

// it is very complicated so try to write clean code that is compare similar data types
